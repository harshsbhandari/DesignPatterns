## Dependency Inversion
The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

In a typical scenario, this principle helps in decoupling high-level logic from low-level implementations, making the code more modular and easier to maintain and extend.
