Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design. 
ISP states that a client should not be forced to depend on interfaces it does not use. 
Instead of having a single large interface, ISP suggests that interfaces should be divided into smaller, more specific ones so that clients only need to know about the methods that are of interest to them.
